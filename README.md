# Enhancing E-Commerce Effectiveness Through Advanced Behavioral Analysis and Customer Segmentation Techniques

This project focuses on enhancing e-commerce strategies by implementing advanced customer segmentation and behavioral analysis methods. 

## Overview

This project leverages synthetic data, machine learning techniques, and geospatial analysis to create a robust framework for e-commerce businesses. Key methods include:
- **RFM Analysis**: To classify customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.
- **Customer Lifetime Value Prediction**: Using regression models to forecast future customer spending.
- **Hybrid Clustering**: Combining K-Means and DBSCAN for noise-tolerant customer segmentation.
- **Geospatial Insights**: Mapping customer locations to identify regional trends.

## Features

- **Synthetic Data**: Data generation using Python's `Faker` library.
- **Clustering Models**: Application of hybrid clustering techniques for segmentation.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping customer distribution and identifying high-value regions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation of clustering and prediction accuracy using Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, MAE, and R-squared.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, PCA
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
- **Geospatial Analysis**: GeoPandas, Folium
